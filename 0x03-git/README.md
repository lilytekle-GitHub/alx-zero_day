Repo-session readme
Of course, I can also work on the same branch as my co-workers and it’s best if i keep up to date with their changes.

For this task – and only for this task – updated my file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time i am allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After i have done that, in my terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin
